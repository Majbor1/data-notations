<blockquote>
<p>The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop
counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile
use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops
limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of
desktop components, although that difference has increasingly
narrowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or
upgradable by the end-user, except for components that can be detached;
in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable.
Some laptops feature socketed processors with sockets such as the Socket
G2, but many laptops use processors that are soldered to the
motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM and storage that is soldered to
the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced. This restriction is one
of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because
the large “tower” cases used in desktop computers are designed so that
new motherboards, hard disks, sound cards, RAM, and other components can
be added. Memory and storage can often be upgraded with some
disassembly, but with the most compact laptops, there may be no
upgradeable components at all.The following sections summarizes the
differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in
comparison to desktop personal computer parts.</p>
